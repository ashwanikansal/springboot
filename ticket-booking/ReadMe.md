## Architecture & Services

### Services Implemented

- **UserBookingService**
    - `loginUser(User user)`
    - `signUp(User user)`
    - `fetchBookings(...)`
    - `cancelBooking(...)`
    - `bookTicket(String source, String destination)`

- **TrainService**
    - `searchTrain(String source, String destination)`
    - `getSeatsAvailable(Train train)`

### Data Handling

- In-memory local database (localDb) used for persisting data temporarily.
- Jackson library is used for serializing/deserializing Java objects to/from JSON.
    - Uses `ObjectMapper` (`readValue` and `writeValue`), and `TypeReference` for lists of objects.
- BCrypt library is used for secure password hashing.

## Tech Stack

- Java (JDK 8+)
- [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) - JSON serialization/deserialization
- [BCrypt](https://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/) - Password hashing

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd irctc-reservation-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Add Jackson and BCrypt libraries to your project (Maven/Gradle or manually).

3. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## Usage

1. **User Signup/Login:**
    - Users can register or log in via the provided API/CLI.

2. **Search Trains:**
    - Fetch a list of trains between two stations with seat availability.

3. **Book Tickets:**
    - Select source/destination, choose a train, and book seats.

4. **View/Download Tickets:**
    - View booking history and fetch ticket details.

## Notes

- All data is stored in-memory; upon restart, the data will be lost.
- Jackson's `ObjectMapper` is configured to map between class fields and JSON keys (e.g., `userId` â†” `user_id`).
- Type information for collections is provided at runtime via Jackson's `TypeReference`.


**Enjoy booking with our IRCTC Reservation Backend!**
